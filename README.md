# Network_intrusion_Detection
Overview of CIC-IDS2017 Dataset
Purpose: The dataset was created for evaluating machine learning models in the context of network intrusion detection, specifically to identify and classify different types of network attacks.

Data Composition: The dataset consists of a variety of records that represent network traffic data. Each record typically contains numerous features extracted from the packets, including protocol information, flow statistics, and flags that indicate specific behaviors.

Key Features: Some of the key features that might be present in the dataset include:

Flow ID: Unique identifier for each network flow.
Source IP: The IP address of the source of the packet.
Destination IP: The IP address of the destination.
Source Port: The port number of the source.
Destination Port: The port number of the destination.
Protocol: The protocol used (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).
Timestamp: Time of the packet capture.
Flow Duration: Total time the flow lasted.
Total Bytes: Total bytes transferred in the flow.
Total Packets: Total number of packets in the flow.
Label: This indicates whether the traffic is benign or represents an attack type (e.g., DoS, DDoS, Port Scanning, etc.).
Attack Types: The dataset includes several types of attacks, such as:

DoS (Denial of Service)
DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)
Port Scanning
Brute Force Attacks
Web Attacks (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS)
Infiltration Attempts
Data Format: The dataset is typically stored in CSV files, where each row corresponds to a specific network flow or packet, and each column represents a specific feature.

Data Analysis and Preprocessing

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, or irrelevant features.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features that may be helpful for your model.
Normalization: Scaling numeric values to ensure consistent input for the LSTM model.
Label Encoding: Converting categorical labels into numerical format for model training.
Usage in  LSTM Model
In LSTM model:

Input Data: The features from dataset (like flow duration, total bytes, etc.) are used as input.
Target Variable: The label (benign or attack type) serves as the target variable for prediction.
Sequence Creation: Since LSTMs work well with sequences, you transform your data into sequences based on time or flow intervals to capture temporal dependencies.
